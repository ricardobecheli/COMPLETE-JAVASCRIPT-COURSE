//DESTRUCTURING IN ARRAYS

/*
            Remembering how an array is MADE:
            const notasMensais = [7.7, 8.9, 6.3, 9.2]
            four positions in this array: from zero to 3.
*/

const [a] = [10]
/*  - in "[a]" here I'm using the brackets to DESTRUCTURE not to build.
    - Just created a a variable "a" that received "10"... wait a second!!!
    
    THIS TEACHER'S LESSON IS VERY CONFUSED 
    BECAUSE HE MIXED SEVERAL CONCEPTS BESIDES DESTRUCTURING, AT THE SAME TIME.
    A TOTAL MESS!
