 /*  DESTRUCTURING AN OBJECT {}
 
    I want to have access to 1 or more of these "INTERNAL DATA" from the object below, like nome, age, etc, and make them become VARIABLES.

    They're inside an object in this lesson or inside an array (next lesson).

    You could say:

    - Easy. Just use the dot notation, as follows:

            let nome = person.nome 
            const age = person.age

    Ok, that is the standard way:

            First comes the type (let, const or var)
            After the type, the identifier (the name of the variable),
            then the equal sign (=, that means "receives")
            and at last the data itself (the value).

    But now we're gonna use the destructuring operator, a simplified way to do the same.

    Look below this line: "person" here is an OBJECT.
    The Whole structure and data form this object.

const person = {
    nome: "Ana",
    age: 21,
    addressNr: 210,
    addressSt: "Av. Santo Amaro",
    courses: {
        engineering: 'undergraduate',
        chemistryGrade: 10,
        cooking: null
    }
}

console.log(person) // Object literals are displayed between braces.
console.table(person) // A table is displayed in the terminal.

const { nome, age } = person // After "const" no name appears to name the constant. Instead, braces mean that a "destructuring" is about to take place.

console.log(nome, age + " | in this row are both constants together in console.log") // Ana, 21
console.log(nome + " | and now, in this row, one at a time. Here only " + nome) // Ana
console.log(age + " | and now, in this row, one at a time. Here only " + age) // 21


const {nome: n, age: a} = person // I can change the const or let or var names.
console.log(n, a) // Ana, 21  | By changing the name, the "storage" place becomes more independent, detached, whatever, maybe avoiding confusion.

const { sobrenome, bemHumorada = true, outraConst = null} = person
// If I try to take an inexistent attribute from the object: Undefined or true. If you set it as true, it gets a "standard value" (- If there's nothing there, please assume true as a standard.).

console.log(sobrenome, bemHumorada, outraConst) // undefined true null
// Any other thing but undefined makes clear that someone has given prevoius attention to that constant or variable.

const {courses: {engineering, chemistryGrade, cooking, tvSetWhatever}} = person

console.log(engineering, chemistryGrade, cooking, tvSetWhatever)
// undergraduate 10 null undefined

/*
Note:
tvSetWhatever is undefined, not error, because it's inside an existent "parent" object variable or const.

In other words:
The path from the parent object to the child variable/const must bewell defined.
Only the LAST item can be undefined.

If you try to extract
    const { f1, soccer } = games
Will resul in error, because thereÂ´s no "games" here.

let stockCar = 10
console.log(stockCar)
