// console.log is used to display something in the computer screen. This is an 1-line comment.

// One line comments are mede by double slash.


console.log(1+3*10);
console.log("Text always between double quotes or...");
//console.log('Or simple quotes');

//the above live of code was neutralized by "commenting".

/* for more than one line comment
just use this,
like you've learned in CSS:
slash asterisk - asterisk slash
*/
