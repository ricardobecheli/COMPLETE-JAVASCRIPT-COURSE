// console.log is used to display something in the computer screen. This is an 1-line comment.

// One line comments are mede by double slash.


console.log(1+3*10);

console.log("Text always between double quotes or..."); //console.log('Or simple quotes');


//the above live of code was neutralized (not executed) by the comment.

/* for more than one line comment
just use this,
like you've learned in CSS:
slash asterisk - asterisk slash
*/

// "Use and abuse of comments in the lessons, but only essential comments at work".
