let sample = 3
// console.log(sample)
//It is 3 so far...

//I can change the value anytime:

sample = 10
console.log(sample)

// I can add to the variable itself:

sample = sample + 30
console.log(sample)

const fixed = 12 // This is the only form to declare a constant in JS.

//fixed = 3  NOT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE / NOT ACCEPTED.

console.log(fixed)
