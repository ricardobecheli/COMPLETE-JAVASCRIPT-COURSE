# COMPLETE-JAVASCRIPT-COURSE
 Starting May 31, 2022 - Let's check the progress by July 25, 2022.

## First: We installed "Code Runner"
Code Runner simulates a terminal inside VS Code.

There's a "play" icon at the top of the coding area.

## Code Sentences
The shortest code snippet. Like phrases, in English. The computer undesrstands the phrase even if broken into several lines, like one word each line. (But who wants such a confused code?).

Example: console.log("2 important concepts: Code Sentences and Code Blocks");

The semicolon is optional at the end of JS sentence.

## Code Blocks
A group of code sentences. Like a paragraph, in English.

## Good practices 1

To define good names for:

1. Folders
2. Files
3. Variables

etc

# After the introduction:

Now we will organize our corse's project.

## Created a new folder:

### js-exercises

"js-exercises" is a sub folder of "COMPLETE-JAVASCRIPT-COURSE".

I am only watching some classes, listening instead of writing in VS Code.

I prefer this way then go back and do excercises IF NECESSARY* because the lessons are too short.

Oh yes indeed!... it was really necessary. If you don't write you can easily forget.
